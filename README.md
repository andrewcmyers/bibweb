# bibweb
Formatted bibliography generator that can read from BibTeX input files but also overlays additional information
from an auxiliary input file and supports user-defined macros ala TeX.

To parse BibTeX, uses the jbibtex package (https://github.com/jbibtex/jbibtex).

For an example of (one possible) output, see http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/pubs.html
