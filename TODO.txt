Make line numbers more accurate in error messages.

Add support for \def to allow overriding definitions locally. However,
this needs to be tied into brace processing.

The syntax is a kludge. I should have just written a grammar. A better
syntax would use braces like this:

pubs {
  ml-tosem: topic: Security
  zm01: topic: Security
  zm02-hosc: topic: Security
  zm01b: topic: Security
  myers-wwos4: topic: Persistence
  myers-thesis: topic: Persistence
  loplas: topic: Persistence
  theta: topic: Languages
  thor-interface: topic: Persistence
  where-clauses: topic: Languages
  bidirectional: topic: Languages
  myers-metaobj: topic: Languages
  java-popl97 {
   topic: Languages
   projectpage: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/polyj
  }
  sigmod96: topic: Persistence
  ml-ifc-97: topic: Security
  castro-sosp97: topic: Persistence
  myers-metaobj: topic: Languages
  ml-sp98: topic: Security
  polyj {
   pubtype: software
   topic: Languages
   project: PolyJ
   projectpage: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/polyj
  }

One thing to watch out for is losing expressive power in macro defns,
though.
